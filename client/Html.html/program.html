          Growth, like trees, cannot be infinite in a  finite and limited world. This reality is more and more acknowledged today. Though designing and creating innovative products  & services is vital to stimulate growth, it is not less vital to reshape our habits, our consumption model, our living standards in order to live better whilst using less non‐renewable resources.<br/>

     <p class="titet">The aspiration for Smart Cities is at the heart of this new paradigm. The population growth rate accentuates the phenomenon of urbanisation and hence the urban pollution increase.
     <br/><br/>Smart Cities entail economic issues (through the derived new markets), as well as social (through new concepts of living urban space), environmental (through sustainable development) and political issues (through the topic of governance).<br/><br/>

         This FCL second summit is a way to answer the « Better City, Better life » challenge and the opportunities created by Smart Cities.</p><br/><br/>
